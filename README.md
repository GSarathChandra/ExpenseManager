# ExpenseManager

The objective is to build an expense manager application with ease of use and simplicity as the central focus. Hence, the whole application sits in a single HTML file, with Javascript code written within, so that the whole application can be "shipped" as a single file. The user can simply download the file and open it in a web browser to get going.

The current version is a barebones application, with no login/session management or report generation. Even the data is stored as a JS variables within the file. Refresh the page and you'll clear all the variables.

I intend to implement the following features to make the application more useful to begin with and functional in the long-run.

The file needs internet access to download the following resources:
i. fonts used(Roboto Slab from Google Fonts)
ii. jQuery JavaScript library
iii. Bootstrap JS & CSS libraries
